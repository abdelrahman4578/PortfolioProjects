Housing Data Cleaning for Analysis
This repository contains the necessary resources and instructions for cleaning housing data in preparation for analysis using SQL Server. The dataset used in this project is a collection of housing information from various sources.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to clean and prepare the housing data for further analysis using SQL Server. The data cleaning process involves handling missing values, standardizing formats, removing duplicates, and addressing any inconsistencies or errors in the dataset.

CleaningHousingDatawithSQL.sql: SQL script containing the commands for cleaning the housing data.
Data Cleaning Process
The following steps were performed to clean the housing data:

Loading the Data: The raw housing data was imported into a SQL Server database table.

Handling Missing Values: Missing values in the dataset were identified and treated appropriately. This involved either imputing missing values or removing rows or columns with excessive missing data using SQL queries and functions.

Standardizing Formats: Inconsistent formats across columns, such as date formats or categorical values, were standardized to ensure uniformity and ease of analysis using SQL string manipulation functions and expressions.

Removing Duplicates: Duplicate records, if any, were identified and removed to maintain data integrity using SQL queries and the appropriate deduplication techniques.

Addressing Inconsistencies: Any inconsistencies or errors in the dataset were addressed, such as correcting typos, aligning data types, or resolving conflicting values using SQL queries and update statements.

Exporting Cleaned Data: The cleaned housing data was exported as data_cleaned.csv for further analysis, using SQL queries to extract the cleaned data into a CSV file.

Usage
To use the cleaned housing data for analysis in SQL Server, follow these steps:

Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or any SQL Server client tool.

Connect to your SQL Server instance and create a new database or use an existing one.

Open the data.sql script in SSMS or your SQL Server client tool.

Execute the SQL script to create the necessary tables and perform the data cleaning steps.

Once the data cleaning process is complete, you can export the cleaned data by executing the appropriate SQL query to generate the data_cleaned.csv file with the cleaned data.

You can now use the cleaned dataset (data_cleaned.csv) for analysis in your preferred data analysis tool or programming language.

Dependencies
This project requires a SQL Server instance and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or any SQL Server client tool to execute the SQL scripts.
